Telecharger is a [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) TUI. It provides the ability to build lists of videos you wish to download, rename the files, saving as audio only and a host of other functionality.

Not all the flags that youtube-dl allows are supported yet but you can provide them as a string on the form and telecharger will sort the rest out for you.

Adding the following extra commands

`--add-metadata --write-all-thumbnails --embed-thumbnail --write-info-json --embed-subs --all-subs`
![Example commnds](./assets/telecharger-extra-commands.gif)

</details>

The SQLite database is created in a `telecharger` directory in your home directory. In the future config will likely live here too.

## Requirements

- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)
- [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/)
- For Notifications
  - [MacOS](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier)
  - Linux: `spd-say` should come with your distro

**Warning**

I have not tested this on windows and doubt it will work there. Sorry.

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/jim-at-jibba/telecharger@latest
```

## Configuration

If there more configuration options that you would like to see in Telecharge, please submit an issue.
